# Dum-Compiler

dum-compiler is a fun project of mine, where I attempt to make, well, a compiler. I'm doing it completely from scratch using the C programming language.
The compiler is for a dummy project called 'Tac'. This name is taken from a tutorial  by [Ianertson](https://www.youtube.com/c/HelloWorldCode): [Make a compiler](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvaIU2QC2uvFnVxXe-XzXJfd4dXGz5qBB).


# How to run
The project uses `Make` as the build tool. 
On Linux/ Unix based systems:
```
> make
> ./parce.o
```

On windows:
Please change the `exec = parcer.o` to `exec = parcer.exe` in the `Makefile`
```
> mingw32-make
> ./parcer.exe
```


> Please note that this is a fun project and not to be taken seriously. I still have  a long way to go
